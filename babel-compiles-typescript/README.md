# `babel-compiles-typescript`

With Babel 7 (currently beta) you can compile TypeScript, so TypeScript can be used just for type checking, if you want. This will create a similar setup like Babel with Flow. This project also tries to use Webpack 4 (currently alpha).

While this example currently compiles without errors, decorators aren't working yet.

To build the example just run `$ yarn && yarn build` and open the `index.html`.
